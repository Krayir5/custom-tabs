## Installation
First you open your servers folder and then in plugins folder you drop TAB and ItemsAdder folders. You need to change KRAYIR logo and by Blockbench you can do that easily and configure your logo at custom_tab.yml with y positions etc. If it's all good to go all you need to do is /tab reload and /iareload, /iazip and you're good to go
